# My-Portfolio
The point of this homework was to create a portfolio webpage. The requirements were to state the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them. I also needed to have clickable links in my header that linked to sections in the page. The developers first application should be bigger than the others.
when you click the images, it takes you to that deployed application.
